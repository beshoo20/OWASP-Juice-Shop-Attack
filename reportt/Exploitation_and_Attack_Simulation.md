Tools and Techniques Used
1- Finding the Admin Path
Tools: Burp Suite, Browser Developer Tools (Inspect Element).
How it worked: Instead of guessing URLs, we inspected the site's source code using the browserâ€™s Developer Tools. By looking at the code and analyzing the structure of the site, we discovered the admin paths, such as /admin and /admin/login. This method is commonly used by attackers to find hidden or unprotected parts of a website by examining the underlying code.
2-Brute Forcing the Admin Login
Tools: Burp Suite.
How it worked: Once we found the admin login page, By sending SQL injection payloads in the username field, we were able to bypass the login mechanism and retrieve the correct password for the admin user. This allowed us to log in with the admin credentials and access areas of the application that should be restricted.

3-Exploiting XSS in the Search Bar
Tools: Burp Suite, Browser Developer Tools.
How it worked: We injected a malicious JavaScript script into the product search bar, and because the app didn't sanitize the input, the script ran in the browser of anyone viewing the results.
