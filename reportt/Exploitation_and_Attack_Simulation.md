Tools and Techniques Used
1- Finding the Admin Path
Tools: Burp Suite, Browser Developer Tools (Inspect Element).
How it worked: Instead of guessing URLs, we inspected the site's source code using the browserâ€™s Developer Tools. By looking at the code and analyzing the structure of the site, we discovered the admin paths, such as /admin and /admin/login. This method is commonly used by attackers to find hidden or unprotected parts of a website by examining the underlying code.
2-Brute Forcing the Admin Login
Tools: Hydra, Burp Suite.
How it worked: Once we found the admin login page, we used Hydra to automate the process of trying many possible passwords until we found the correct one.
3-Exploiting XSS in the Search Bar
Tools: Burp Suite, Browser Developer Tools.
How it worked: We injected a malicious JavaScript script into the product search bar, and because the app didn't sanitize the input, the script ran in the browser of anyone viewing the results.
