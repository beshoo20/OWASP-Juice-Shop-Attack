Scope
We tested the OWASP Juice Shop application, focusing on:
1-The website itself.
2-The underlying APIs (the communication between the app and the server).
3-Different features like login, product search, and admin functions.


Testing Approach
We used a black-box testing method, meaning we tested the application as an attacker wouldâ€”without knowing the internal workings of the app. This type of testing simulates how a real-world hacker might try to exploit the system.


Tools Used
We used several tools to carry out the testing, including:
1-Burp Suite: To capture and analyze web traffic.
2-Hydra: A tool used for brute-forcing passwords.
3-Kali Linux: The operating system that runs all the tools.
