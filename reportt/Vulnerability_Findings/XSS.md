What happened: The search bar allowed attackers to insert harmful JavaScript code. This code then runs in the browsers of other users who view the search results.
Why itâ€™s a problem: An attacker could steal user data, hijack sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites.
Proof: We tested the search bar by entering a simple script (<script>alert('XSS')</script>) and saw that it executed in the browser.
Fix: Make sure the app checks all user inputs for dangerous code and prevents it from being executed
