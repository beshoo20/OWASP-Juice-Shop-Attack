What happened: The admin login page had no protection against multiple login attempts. Using a tool called Hydra, we were able to guess the admin password by trying many options.
Why itâ€™s a problem: Without protections like limiting the number of failed login attempts, attackers can easily guess passwords, especially if the password is weak.
Proof: We successfully logged in as the admin by guessing the password by Hydra tool .
Fix: Implement features like limiting login attempts and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).
