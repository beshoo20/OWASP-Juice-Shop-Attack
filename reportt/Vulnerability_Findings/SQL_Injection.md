What happened:
We identified the admin login page and attempted to log in with the admin email (admin@juice-sh.op) but an incorrect password. Using Burp Suite, we intercepted the login request and analyzed the SQL query behind the login mechanism. We then performed a SQL injection attack on the password field to retrieve the correct password for the admin account. After inserting a specially crafted payload, we were able to bypass authentication and get the admin password.

Why itâ€™s a problem:
Without proper input validation or sanitization, SQL injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries. By injecting malicious SQL code, attackers can bypass authentication and access sensitive information from the database, including passwords. This vulnerability can give attackers complete access to an admin account, which poses a serious security risk.

Proof:
We successfully injected SQL payloads into the password field using Burp Suite, and the query was manipulated to reveal the correct password for the admin account. Once we had the password, we logged in as the admin and gained full access to the admin panel.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, the application should use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which safely handle user inputs and prevent SQL injection. Additionally, input validation should be implemented to sanitize any user inputs, ensuring that no malicious SQL code can be executed.
