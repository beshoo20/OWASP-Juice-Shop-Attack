What happened: The attacker was able to guess the admin login page by simply trying different URL combinations.
Why itâ€™s a problem: If an attacker finds this admin page, they can try to break into the admin account and control the entire application.
Proof: By inspecting the site's code and structure, we discovered hints pointing to the admin paths, such as /admin and /admin/login. These paths were then tested and confirmed to lead to the admin login page.
